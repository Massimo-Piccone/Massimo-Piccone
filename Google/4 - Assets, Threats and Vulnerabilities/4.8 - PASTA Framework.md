# PASTA Model Framework

> Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis

## Scenario

As a member of the growing security team at a sneaker enthusiast company, you're tasked with performing a threat model for their new mobile app, which facilitates buying and selling shoes. You will use the PASTA framework to identify security requirements for this app.

## Components of PASTA

- Define Business and Security Objectives
- Define the Technical Scope
- Decompose Application (Data Flow Diagram)
- Threat Analysis
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Attack Modeling (Attack Tree)
- Risk Analysis and Impact

## Implementation

### Define Business and Security Objectives 

| **Business**                        | **Security**                                            |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Process transactions                | One account, one payment method                        |
| Users can create profiles           | Protected by passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication  |
| Accept multiple payment methods     | Compliance with PCI-DSS                                |
| Database utilization                | Provide multi-factor authentication                     |

**Context Diagram:**

| **Users**            | **Admins**                |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Add sneakers to cart | Store & update catalogs   |
| Pay for products     | Issue invoice             |
| Send inquiry         | Answer inquiry            |

### Define the Technical Scope

- API for data exchange between customers, employees, and the system.
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- SHA-256 (Hash functions to protect sensitive data)
- SQL

### Decompose Application

**Data Flow Diagram Level 0 (Context Diagram):**

### Threat Analysis

- SQL Injection
- Session Hijacking
- Denial-of-Service (DoS)
- Integration issues and service disruptions

### Vulnerability Analysis

- Lack of prepared statements (parameterized queries) for SQL injection prevention
- Weak credential logins
- Overloaded application server
- Broken API Token

### Attack Modeling

**Attack Tree Diagram:**

### Risk Analysis and Impact

- SHA-256 Hashing
- Incident response procedures
- Playbook (security policy)
- Password policy
- Principle of Least Privilege
- Zero-Trust Model
