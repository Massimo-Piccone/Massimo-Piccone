# Access Control Worksheet
> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Scenario

You are the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business. Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account. The finance manager insists they didn’t make a mistake. Fortunately, the payment was stopped in time. The owner has asked you to investigate the incident to prevent future occurrences. 

To address this, you will need to conduct an assessment of the incident to understand what transpired. First, you will review the access log related to the incident. Next, you will take notes to help identify a potential threat actor. Then, you will identify issues with the access controls that were exploited. Finally, you will recommend mitigation strategies to improve the business’s access controls and reduce the likelihood of similar incidents in the future.
