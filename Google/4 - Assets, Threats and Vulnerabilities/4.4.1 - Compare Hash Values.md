# Compare Hash Values

## Description
As a security analyst, one of the essential security controls we can implement is hashing. Hashing generates a code that is irreversible and uniquely identifies the contents of a file, known as a unique identifier (hash value or digest). For instance, a malicious program might imitate an original program. Even if just one line of code differs from the original, it will produce a different hash value. Security teams can then detect the malicious program and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk.

## Generate Hashes
To begin, use the `ls` command to display the files within the directory. We have two files, and we want to view their contents using the `cat` command. As shown in the image below, the contents of both files appear to be identical.


```
analyst@1234567899:~$ ls
file1.txt file2.txt
analyste£62£0dd57549：~$ cat file1.txt
X50! P&@AP[4\P2X54 (P^) 7CC) 7)$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE! $H+H*
analystef62£0dd57549：~$ cat file2.txt
X50! P&@AP[4\P2X54 (P^) 7CC) 7)SEICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE! $H+H*
```

We can find if the files are different or not by using the `sha256` command. From the picture below we can see both files have different hash values.

```
analyst@123456789:~$ sha256sum file1.txt
131£95c51cc819465£a1797£6ccac£9d494aaa££46£a3eac73ae63££bdfd8267 file1.txt
analystef62£0dd57549：~5 sha256sum file2.txt
2558ba9a4cadle69804ce032222029526179291a5e38cb723320e83a£9ca017b file2.txt
```

## Compare Hashes Files
Let’s generate the hash of the `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` to a new file for `file1hash` and `file2hash` respectively.  

```
analyst@123456789:~$ sha256sum file1.txt
131695c51c819465fa1797£6ccac£9d494aaa££46£3eac73e63££bd£d8267 file1.txt
analyst@£62£0dd57549:~$ sha256sum file2.txt
2558ba9a4cad1e69804ce032222029526179a91=5e38cb723320e83af9ca017b file2.txt
```

Inspect the contents of them by using `cat` commands. Last but not least, compare both files by using `cmp` command.

```
analyst@£62£0dd57549:~$ sha256sum file1.txt >> file1hash
analyst@E62E0dd57549:"5 sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash
sha256sum: £1121.tat: No such file or directory
analyst@E62E0dd57549:~f sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash
```

```
analyst@£620dd57549:~$ cat file1hash
131£95c51c819465£a1797£6ccac£9d494zza££46£a3eac73a63££bd£d8267 file1.txt
analysteE62£0dd57549：~$ cat file2hash
2558ba924cad1e69804ce03a222029526179a91a538@b72322083a9ca017b file2.txt
analyst@£62£0dd57549:~$ cmp filelhash file?hash
file1hash file2hash differ: char 1, line 1
```

## Summary
Though the contents of both files appear to be identical, only hash values of each file that can determine if they are the same or not.
