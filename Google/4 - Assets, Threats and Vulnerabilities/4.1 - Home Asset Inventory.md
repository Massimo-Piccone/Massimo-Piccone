# Home Asset Inventory
In todayâ€™s world, information is one of the most valuable assets, often accessed over a network. Networks typically connect various devices, each potentially an entry point to other valuable assets. Maintaining an inventory of network-connected devices is a crucial asset management tool, helping identify sensitive assets needing extra protection.

## Project Description

Imagine you're operating a small business from your home office. 
> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

I think creating an inventory of my network devices will help in deciding which ones contain sensitive information that requires enhanced security measures.

To achieve this I will:
1. Identify the devices connected to the home network.
2. List the essential characteristics and vulnerabilities.
3. Arrange in order of priority, High to Low.
