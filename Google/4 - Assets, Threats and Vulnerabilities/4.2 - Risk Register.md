# Risk Register
> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Operational Environment:

The bank is situated in a coastal region with minimal crime. The bank's data is managed by a total of 120 employees, comprising 100 on-site staff and 20 remote workers. The customer base includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 business accounts. Marketing for the bank's services is conducted through a professional sports team and ten local businesses within the community. Financial regulations mandate that the bank must ensure the security of its data and funds, including maintaining sufficient cash on hand daily to meet Federal Reserve standards.

|                  | Supply chain disruption          | Delays in delivery due to natural disasters.                 | 1              | 3            | 3            |

**Notes:**

Considering the risks associated with each asset in its operational environment:

- Engaging with third-party companies may increase data risks as these entities might have access to sensitive information.
- Risks related to supply chain disruption and natural disasters are less concerning due to the low crime rate in the area and the unlikelihood of such events.

## Risk Matrix 

| **Impact** \ **Chance** | **Rare** (1) | **Likely** (2) | **Certain** (3) |
|-------------------------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Catastrophic** (3)          | 3            | 6              | 9               |
| **Moderate** (2)              | 1            | 4              | 6               |
| **Low** (1)                   | 1            | 2              | 3               |

- **Asset:** The asset at risk of being harmed, damaged, or stolen.
- **Risk(s):** A potential risk to the organization's information systems and data. Description: A vulnerability that might lead to a security incident.
- **Chance:** Score from 1-3 of the chances of a vulnerability being exploited. A 1 means there's a low likelihood, a 2 means there's a moderate likelihood, and a 3 means there's a high likelihood.
- **Impact:** Score from 1-3 of the potential damage the threat would cause to the business. A 1 means a low severity impact, a 2 is a moderate severity impact, and a 3 is a high severity impact.
- **Priority:** How quickly a risk should be addressed to avoid the potential incident. Use the following formula to calculate the overall score: Likelihood x Impact Severity = Risk.
