# Data Leak Worksheet

> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Scenario

You work for an educational technology company that created an application designed to help teachers automatically grade assignments. This application collects a variety of data from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students. Recently, there was a data leak involving internal business plans that were shared on social media. An investigation revealed that the leak occurred because an employee inadvertently shared confidential documents with a customer. An audit is currently being conducted to prevent similar incidents in the future.

A supervisor has provided information about the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not followed during a sales meeting. You are tasked with analyzing the situation and finding ways to prevent such occurrences in the future.

## Incident Summary

During a meeting, a sales manager granted access to a folder of internal documents to their team. This folder contained files related to a new, undisclosed product, customer analytics, and promotional materials. After the meeting, the manager did not revoke access to the folder but advised the team to wait for official approval before distributing the promotional materials.

Subsequently, a sales team member, during a video call with a business partner, mistakenly shared a link to the internal folder instead of the intended link to the promotional materials. The business partner, unaware of the error, posted the link to their companyâ€™s social media page, assuming it was promotional content.

| **Control** | **Least Privilege** |
|:---|:---|
| **Issue(s)** | The internal folder's access was unintentionally made public to everyone, including both the sales team and manager. The business partner should not have shared confidential information on social media without proper authorization. |
| **Review** | NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 outlines how organizations can safeguard data privacy by applying the principle of least privilege. It includes guidance on enhancing controls to improve the effectiveness of least privilege. The principle of least privilege means that users or entities should only have access to the specific data, resources, and applications necessary for their tasks.|
| **Recommendation(s)** | Implement role-based access to restrict sensitive resources according to user roles. Perform regular audits of user privileges. |
| **Justification** | Restricting internal files to employees only will prevent unauthorized access. Regular audits by managers and security teams will help control access to team files and minimize the risk of sensitive information being exposed. |

## Security Plan 

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is structured hierarchically, resembling a tree. It starts with broad security functions and becomes more detailed through categories, subcategories, and individual security controls.

| **Function** | **Category** | **Subcategory** | **Reference(s)** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Protect | PR.DS: Data Security | PR.DS-5: Protections Against Data Leaks |NIST SP 800-53: AC-6|


In this example, the controls implemented to safeguard against data leaks are outlined in NIST SP 800-53, which provides guidelines for ensuring the privacy of information systems.

*Note: References are often hyperlinked to the relevant guidelines or regulations, allowing easy access to detailed information on implementing specific controls. It's typical to find multiple links to various sources in the references column.*


### NIST SP 800-53: AC-6

NIST developed SP 800-53 to offer businesses a customizable framework for information privacy. It serves as a comprehensive guide detailing various control categories. Each control includes the following key components:

- **Control:** Definition of the security control.
- **Discussion:** Explanation of how the control should be implemented.
- **Control Enhancements:** Suggestions to enhance the effectiveness of the control.

| **AC-6** | **Least Privilege**|
|:---|:---|
| **Control:** | Users should be granted only the minimal access and authorization required to perform their tasks.|
| **Discussion:** | Processes, user accounts, and roles should be structured to enforce least privilege, ensuring users operate only at the necessary privilege levels to meet business objectives. |
| **Control Enhancements:** | 1. Limit access to sensitive resources based on user roles. 2. Automatically revoke access to information after a certain period. 3. Maintain activity logs of provisioned user accounts. 4. Conduct regular audits of user privileges.| 

*Note: In the access controls category, SP 800-53 lists least privilege as control AC-6.*
