# Parking Lot USB Drive
> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Scenario

As a member of the security team at Rhetorical Hospital, you find a USB stick with the hospital's logo in the parking lot one morning. Since there's no one around, you decide to pick it up out of curiosity. 

You bring the USB drive to your office, where your team uses virtualization software on a workstation. This software allows you to safely investigate unfamiliar USB drives by running a simulated instance of the computer, which is isolated from other files and networks. This way, any potential malicious software on the USB drive cannot affect other systems.

The USB drive contains a mix of personal and work-related files, including family and pet photos, a new hire letter, and an employee shift schedule. Consider how an attacker might exploit this information if they obtained it, and whether this event might have been staged.

## Solution

| Points           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Contents**     | Not all documents are personal; however, Jorge would not want them to be public. Some work files include personal information and details about hospital operations. |
| **Attacker Mindset** | An attacker could use the obtained information to deceive Jorge, possibly by sending malicious emails to extract more personal data (e.g., payment card information). |
| **Risk Analysis** | To mitigate risks, educate employees about such attacks to raise awareness and prevent recurrence (managerial control). Additionally, implement protection systems like antivirus software and regular device scans (operational control). To prevent the execution of malicious code from USB drives, disable the “autoplay” feature or ensure files are scanned through an email with antivirus protection. |
