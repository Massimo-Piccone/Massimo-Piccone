# Vulnerability Assessment
> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Scenario

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, as many employees work remotely from various locations worldwide. Employees regularly query the server to find potential customers. However, the database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a significant vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks to decision-makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

## Report

**Date:** November 14th, 2023 - January 14th, 2024 (3 Months)

### System Description
The database server operates on Debian Linux with 1TB of memory and a powerful CPU processor. It hosts a MySQL database management system. The network connection uses an IPv4 address, but the security measure employs SSL instead of TLS.

### Scope
This report focuses on the current access controls of the system. The assessment was conducted from November 14th, 2023, to January 14th, 2024. The risk analysis of the information system follows guidelines from [NIST SP 800-30](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final). Other versions published by NIST may also be referenced.

### Purpose
The database server stores a large amount of data, including customer information, campaign details, and analytics that track performance and personalize marketing efforts. Due to its critical nature, the system must be secured from unauthorized personnel.

### Risk Assessment
| Threat Source       | Threat Event                                                                 | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:----------:|:--------:|:----:|
| Hackers             | Sensitive information is leaked to the public due to exfiltration             |     3      |    3     |  9   |
| Former Employees    | Sensitive information is leaked to the public or sold to competitors         |     2      |    3     |  6   |
| Current Employees   | Disrupt operation activities                                                  |     2      |    3     |  6   |
| Customers           | Alter information                                                             |     1      |    3     |  3   |

### Approach
Threat sources and events were identified based on the likelihood of incidents due to open access permissions. Severity was measured against the impact on day-to-day operational needs. Hackers could potentially publish sensitive information on the internet, damaging the organization's reputation. Former employees, although less likely, may leak or sell confidential information to competitors. Current employees might disrupt operational activities, while customers could alter information maliciously.

### Remediation Strategy
- Make the database server private to protect confidentiality.
- Implement Role-Based Access (RBA).
- Enforce authentication, authorization, and auditing practices to ensure only authorized users can access the database server.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (e.g., SMS, email, ID card, employee card).
- Encrypt data using TLS instead of SSL (as TLS is the newer version of SSL) to prevent unauthorized internet users from accessing the database server.
