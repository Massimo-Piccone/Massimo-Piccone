# Final Report

> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Scenario

On January 22, 2024, at 7:20 p.m. PT, an individual gained unauthorized access to customer personal identifiable information (PII) and financial information. Approximately 50,000 customer records were affected, with an estimated financial impact of $100,000 in direct costs and potential loss of revenue. The incident was reported after an employee received an email from an external source on January 20, 2024, claiming they had stolen customer data and demanding $25,000 in cryptocurrency. The email was deleted as spam. A second email on January 22, 2024, with a sample of the stolen data and an increased demand of $50,000 prompted the employee to notify the security team. The investigation revealed a vulnerability in the e-commerce web application, which allowed the attacker to perform a forced browsing attack and access customer transaction data by modifying the order number in the URL string of a purchase confirmation page. The organization disclosed the breach and offered free identity protection services. The key lesson learned is the importance of performing routine vulnerability scans and penetration testing. The investigation found that thousands of purchase confirmation pages were exposed, and a control mechanism to block unauthorized URL requests is recommended.

## Executive Summary

The incident involved data theft, occurring on January 22, 2024, at 7:20 p.m. An attacker exploited a vulnerability in the e-commerce web application through a forced browsing attack, accessing customer PII and financial data. Approximately 50,000 records were affected, with an estimated $100,000 in financial loss. The incident is closed with a thorough investigation completed. Recommendations include:

- Implement access control mechanisms.
- Perform routine vulnerability scans.

## Timeline

- **January 20, 2024, 3:13 p.m.**: An employee received an email from an external source claiming they had stolen customer data and requested $25,000 in cryptocurrency. The email was deleted as spam.
- **January 22, 2024**: The employee received another email from the same sender with a sample of the stolen data and a $50,000 demand. The employee notified the security team, initiating the investigation.

## Investigation

The root cause was identified as a vulnerability in the e-commerce web application, which allowed a forced browsing attack. The attacker accessed and exfiltrated customer transaction data by modifying the order number in the URL of a purchase confirmation page. Analysis of web application access logs revealed that the attacker accessed thousands of purchase confirmation pages.

## Response and Remediation

The organization worked with the public relations department to disclose the breach and offer free identity protection services to affected customers.

## Recommendations

- Perform routine vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
- Implement access control mechanisms:
  - Allowlisting to restrict access to a specified set of URLs and block all other requests.
  - Ensure that only authenticated users have access to content.
