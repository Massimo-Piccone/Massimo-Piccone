# Splunk 

> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.


## Overview
Security information and event management (SIEM) tools like Splunk are crucial for security analysts as they offer a platform for storing, analyzing, and reporting data from various sources. Splunk uses a querying language known as Search Processing Language (SPL), which employs pipes and wildcards. Efficient searches help in identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.

## Scenario
As a security analyst at Buttercup Games, your task is to investigate potential security issues with the mail server by examining failed SSH logins for the root account.

The data you'll upload into Splunk includes:
* `mailsv` - Buttercup Games' mail server. Focus on events from this host.
* `www1`, `www2`, `www3` - Web applications of Buttercup Games.
* `vendor_sales` - Data on Buttercup Games' retail sales.

## Objective 
1. Upload sample log data.
2. Search through indexed data.
3. Assess search results.
4. Identify different data sources.
5. Find failed SSH logins for the root account.

## Step-by-step

> SIEM tools process data into searchable events that can be queried, viewed, and analyzed.

1. Log in or sign up for Splunk.
2. Click "Add Data" on the Splunk bar.
3. Upload the data by selecting and uploading [`tutorialdata.zip`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nDz_DZB4ADbD4tvaDa54_l1FoT_jtVy4/view).

4. Go to the Search and Reporting tab, enter `index=main` in the search bar to view the data repository, and select `All time` to see events from all time periods.
> Adjust the time range with the dropdown or time modifiers. A shorter time range yields quicker results and uses fewer resources. In this case, `all time` is selected.

5. Review these common components: `host`, `source`, `sourcetype`.
* Host: Shows the device or system that generated the event.

* Source: Indicates where the event data originated within a specific device or system.

* Sourcetype: Defines the event data's format and structure, guiding Splunk in parsing and interpreting the information.

6. To examine failed SSH logins for the root account on the mail server, search using `index=main host=mailsv` to filter events from the mail server.

7. Search for failed root logins by entering `index=main host=mailsv fail* root` in the search bar. This will expand the search to include terms like `failure`, `failed`, etc., and filter for events containing `root`.

8. Investigation:
   * Over 100,000 events are recorded in the main index across `all time`.
   * The `host` field indicates the event's originating device or system.
   * `vendor_sales` provides data on retail sales, like product quantities sold.
   * As of February 11th, 2024, there have been 346 failed SSH logins for the root account on the mail server.
