# Chronicle

> Chronicle is a cloud service SIEM tool built on Google's core infrastructure, enabling enterprises to securely retain, analyze, and search extensive amounts of security and network telemetry.

## Overview

In Chronicle, events can be searched using the Search field. Procedural Filtering allows refining search results by including or excluding specific event types or log sources. YARA-L, a computer language, is used to create rules for searching ingested log data. Chronicle supports two search types: Unified Data Mode (UDM) and Raw Log Search.
* **Unified Data Mode (UDM):** The default and faster search method, retrieving indexed and normalized security data.
* **Raw Log Search:** Slower, as it searches unparsed logs and supports regular expressions for precise pattern matching.

## Scenario
> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

As a security analyst at a financial services company, you receive an alert about a phishing email with a suspicious domain, `signin.office365x24.com`. Your task is to investigate if other employees received similar emails and accessed this domain using [Chronicle](https://demo.backstory.chronicle.security/?warstory=).

## Expectation
* Access threat intelligence reports on the domain.
* Identify assets that accessed the domain.
* Evaluate HTTP events related to the domain.
* Determine which assets submitted login information.
* Identify additional related domains.

## Step-by-step

1. **Launch Chronicle.**
2. **Perform a domain search:**
   * Search for `signin.office365x24.com` and click on the domain under `DOMAINS` to view results. Below are the screenshots of the legacy view, VT, and IP address `40.100.174.34`.
