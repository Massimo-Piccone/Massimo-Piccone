# Suricata - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) 
> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Overview
Suricata can be utilized in three distinct modes:
1. **IDS Mode:** Monitors network traffic, raising alerts on suspicious activity, typically in a host-based setup.
2. **IPS Mode:** Detects and blocks malicious activities, requiring IPS mode to be enabled.
3. **Network Security Monitoring (NSM):** Logs network data, aiding forensics and incident response by capturing traffic for analysis.

Suricata's detection method is based on signature analysis, which involves three core components:
1. **Action:** Defines the response when a match is found, e.g., alert, pass, drop, or reject.
2. **Header:** Contains network traffic details such as IP addresses, ports, and protocol.
3. **Rule Options:** Allows customization of the signatures.

  
| **Action** | **Header** | **Rule options** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| alert | tcp 10.120.170.17 any -> 133.113.202.181 80 | (msg: "Hello"; sid:1234; rev:1;) |


### Monitoring with Suricata

In a typical scenario, a security analyst configures Suricata to monitor network traffic and trigger alerts. You would follow these steps:
1. **Custom Rules:** Create and run custom rules to monitor network traffic, using the provided `sample.pcap` and `custom.rules` files.
2. **Logs Examination:** Analyze the results in `fast.log` for a quick view of alerts and delve into `eve.json` for detailed event data.

**Key Files:**
- **sample.pcap:** Packet capture file containing network traffic data for testing.
- **custom.rules:** File to define and test custom Suricata rules.
- **fast.log:** Contains quick alert logs, useful for basic checks.
- **eve.json:** The primary log file in JSON format, providing comprehensive event details.

## Examine a Custom Rule
#### 1. Find rules.
> `ls` displays files and directories. Option `-l` shows some results in longform.

```
Massimo@123456789:~$ ls -l
total 64
-rw-r--r-- 1 analyst root 141 Sep  9 04:36 custom.rules
-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root 57462 Feb  9 04:36 sample.pcap
```
> Use `cat` to display contents of `custom.rules` file.

#### 2. Show rules.
```
Massimo@123456789:~$ cat custom.rules
alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"GET on wire";
flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)
```
#### 3. Breakdown `custom.rules`

#### **Action:** `alert`
  - The rule will generate an alert when network traffic matches the specified criteria.

#### **Header:** `http` 
- The header section is used to define the protocol (HTTP) and the direction of the traffic (from `$HOME_NET` to `$EXTERNAL_NET`).

#### **Rule Options:**
- `msg:"GET on wire";` When the rule triggers, the alert will display the message "GET on wire" to indicate the type of traffic that matched the rule.

- `flow:established,to_server;` This option specifies that the rule should only match traffic going from the client to the server. 

- `content:"GET";http_method;` This option tells Suricata to look for the specific string "GET", `http_method;` keyword ensures that Suricata is looking for the "GET" method specifically within the HTTP protocol.

- `sid:12345;` This is a unique identifier for the rule, known as a Snort ID (SID). 

- `rev:3;` The revision number of the rule, indicating its version.

#### Summary
*This Suricata rule is designed to alert on HTTP traffic where the request method is "GET". It applies to traffic flowing from `$HOME_NET` to `$EXTERNAL_NET` and only to packets that are part of established connections going from the client to the server. The rule's message will be "GET on wire", and it has a unique SID of 12345 and is at revision 3.*

## Test the Rule
#### Check the Suricata logs file.
```
Massimo@123456789:~$ ls -l /var/log/suricata
total 0
```
> The folder is empty as it should be.

#### Run Suricata using the `custom.rules`
```
Massimo@123456789:~$ sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none
9/2/2024 -- 05:14:47 - <Notice> - This is Suricata version 6.0.1 RELEASE running
9/2/2024 -- 05:14:48 - <Notice> - All 2 packet processing threads, 4 management threads
9/2/2024 -- 05:14:48 - <Notice> - Signal Received. Stopping engine.
9/2/2024 -- 05:14:48 - <Notice> - Pcap-file module read 1 files, 200 packets, 54238 bytes
```
> `-r sample.pcap`: Uses the `sample.pcap` file to simulate network traffic. <br>
`-S custom.rules`: Instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the `custom.rules` file.<br>
`-k none`: Disables checksum validation to avoid issues with packet integrity during testing.<br>

#### Check the Suricata logs file again.
```
Massimo@123456789:~$ ls -l /var/log/suricata
total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1419 Feb  9 05:14 eve.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  292 Feb  9 05:14 fast.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3238 Feb  9 05:14 stats.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1495 Feb  9 05:14 suricata.log
```

## Examine the Output

#### Check for Alerts in `fast.log`:
```
Massimo@123456789:~$ cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log
11/23/2022-12:38:34.624866  [**] [1:12345:31] GET on wire [Classification: (null)]  [Priority: 3]  {TCP} 172.21.224.2:49652 -> 142.250.1.139:80
11/23/2022-12:38:58.958203  [**] [1:12345:3] GET on wire  [Classification: (null)]  [Priority: 3]  {TCP} 172.21.224.2:58494 -> 142.250.1.102:80
```
> This command displays the contents of the `fast.log` file, showing any alerts generated by the rule.

#### Extract Specific Event Details:
   ```
Massimo@123456789:~$jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json
["2022-11-23T12:38:34.624866+0000", 1169988086560917, "GET on wire", "TCP", "142.250.1.139"]
["2022-11-23T12:38:58.958203+0000"  1298656718394612, "GET on wire", "TCP", "142.250.1.102"]
   ```
> This command extracts and displays specific fields from `eve.json` such as timestamp, flow ID, alert signature, protocol, and destination IP.<br>
> Press `Q` to exit the `less` command and return to the command-line prompt.

In the `eve.json` file, you can find the following:
  - The severity level for the initial alert retrieved by the `jq` command is 3.
  - The last event in the `eve.json` file shows the destination IP address as 142.250.1.102.
  - The alert signature for the first entry in `eve.json` is "GET on wire."
