# Project description

> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Files in Linux
In this scenario, the analyst team tasked me to execute some organizational tasks. The following are as follows:

1. Find and search files
2. Create and remove a directory
3. Move and remove a file
4. Create and edit a file

The operating system is Linux, indicating that the tasks require a command-line interface (Linux Bash shell) approach via Linux Terminal.

```

## Find and search files
Find and search files
The analyst team asked me to locate a log file whose lines contain the text string `error`. The file is `server_logs.txt` within the directory logs. We can examine the actual lines within the file by using `cat server_logs.txt` after `cd` `logs`/`cat` `/home/ analyst/10gs/server_logs.txt` command. The image below shows the entire lines of the text.

```
Massimo@123456789:~/logs$ cat server_logs.txt 
2022-09-28 13:55:55 info     User logged on successfully
2022-09-28 13:56:22 error    The password is incorrect
2022-09-28 13:56:48 warning  The file storage is 75% full
2022-09-28 15:55:55 info     User logged on successfully
2022-09-28 15:56:22 error    The username is incorrect
2022-09-28 15:56:48 warning  The file storage is 90% full
2022-09-28 16:55:55 info     User navigated to settings page
2022-09-28 16:56:22 error    The password is incorrect
2022-09-28 16:56:48 warning  The current user's password expires in 15 days
2022-09-29 13:55:55 info     User logged on successfully
2022-09-29 13:56:22 error    An unexpected error occurred
2022-09-29 13:56:48 warning  The file storage is 90% full
2022-09-29 15:55:55 info     User navigated to settings page
2022-09-29 15:56:22 error    Unauthorized access
2022-09-29 15:56:48 warning  The file atorage is 758 full
2022-09-29 16:55:55 info     User requested security reports
2022-09-29 16:56:22 error    Unauthorized access
2022-09-29 16:56:48 warning  The current user's password expires in 15 days
```

Now, let’s filter this file so it will return a list of the lines that match the text string “error” in that file. The command `grep error server_logs.txt` will make it happen. As the result shows below, six lines match the text string "`error`".

```
Massimo@123456789:~/logs$ grep error server_logs.txt
2022-09-28 13:56:22 error The password is incorrect
2022-09-28 15:56:22 error The username is incorrect
2022-09-28 16:56:22 error The password is incorrect
2022-09-29 13:56:22 error An unexpected error occurred
2022-09-29 15:56:22 error Unauthorized access
2022-09-29 16:56:22 error Unauthorized access
```

The analyst team also would like me to locate files whose names contain `Q1` and `access` within the `users` directory. First, let's write the command `cd /home/analyst/reports/users` to enter `users` directory and `ls` / `ls - la` commands to view all the files within the directory.

```
Massimo@123456789:~/logs$ cd /home/analyst/reports/users
Massimo@123456789:~/reports/users$ ls -la
total 56
drwxr-xr-x  2 analyst root     4096 Dec 20 05:24 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 analyst root     4096 Dec 20 05:24 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst   85 Dec 20 05:24 Q1_access.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst  251 Dec 20 05:24 Q1_added_users.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst  219 Dec 20 05:24 Q1_deleted_users.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst   86 Dec 20 05:24 Q2_access.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst  251 Dec 20 05:24 Q2_added_users.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst  220 Dec 20 05:24 Q2_deleted_users.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst   85 Dec 20 05:24 Q3_access.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst  251 Dec 20 05:24 Q3_added_users.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst  220 Dec 20 05:24 Q3_deleted_users.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst   86 Dec 20 05:24 Q4_access.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst  251 Dec 20 05:24 Q4_added_users.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 analyst analyst  220 Dec 20 05:24 Q4_deleted_users.txt
```

This command (`grep`) will allow us to find the files whose names contain `Q1`: `1s | grep Q1` (make sure you're already in the directory) or `ls /home/analyst/reports/users |grep Q1`. There are three files associated with `Q1`.

```
Massimo@123456789:~/reports/users$ ls | grep Q1
Q1_access.txt
Q1_added_users.txt
Q1_deleted_users.txt
```

Using the same logic, we can locate a file whose name contains `access`: `ls | grep access` (make sure you're already in the directory) or `ls /home/ analyst/reports/users | grep access` As the result shows, there are four files associated with `access`.

```
Massimo@123456789:~/reports/users$ ls | grep access
Q1_access.txt
Q2_access.txt
Q3_access.txt
Q4_access.txt
```

Last but not least, the analyst team would like to search information contained in user files and report on users that were added and deleted from the system. They would like to search for the
`Q2_deleted_users.txt` file within the `users` directory for the username `jhill`. As the
result shows, we found `jhill` in this file. 

`grep jhill l2_deleted_users.txt`

```
Massimo@123456789:~/reports/users$ grep jhill Q2_deleted_users.txt
1025 jhill Sales
```

To see whose people have been added to the `Human Resources` department, we can use `grep` command. For more than one word, we should use "" to execute the command.

`grep "Human Resources" Q4_added_users.txt`

```
Massimo@123456789:~/reports/users$ grep "Human Resources" Q4_added_users.txt
1151    sshah   Human Resources
1145    msosa   Human Resources
```

## Create and remove a directory

The analyst team would like me to create a new directory named `logs` and remove `temp` directory from the system. Here's the command line to create and remove the directory: 
- `mkdir logs` (create)

```
Massimo@123456789:~$ mkdir logs
Massimo@123456789:~$ ls
logs notes reports temp
```

- `rmdir temp` (remove)
```
Massimo@123456789:~$ rmdir temp
Massimo@123456789:~$ ls
logs notes reports 
```

## Move and remove a file

The team would like to move `Q3patches.txt` file to another directory. In the `Notes` directory (please navigate here), the command mv `Q3patches.txt /home/analyst/report` will move the file to the `notes` directory.

```
Massimo@123456789:~$ cd /home/analyst/notes
Massimo@123456789:~/notes$ cd notes
-bash: cd: notes: No such file or directory
Massimo@123456789:~/notes$ mv Q3patches.txt /home/analyst/reports/
Massimo@123456789:~/notes$ ls /home/analyst/reports
Q1patches.txt Q2patches.txt Q3patches.txt
```

The team would like me to remove `tempnotes` as it is no longer required in the `notes` directory. The command `rm tempnotes.txt` will allow us to delete it (please make sure to use `cd` command to navigate to notes directory).

```
Massimo@123456789:~/notes$ rm tempnotes.txt
Massimo@123456789:~/notes$ ls
Massimo@123456789:~/notes$
```

## Create and edit a file

The analyst team would like me to create a new file and edit it. The command `touch tasks.txt` allows us to create a file. On the other hand, the command `nano tasks.txt` allows us to edit a file. Make sure to press CTRL + X to exit from the nano editor. When being asked "Save modified bufferer", press Y to save the new data to the file. Then, please press enter to confirm that the file name to write is tasks.txt. Use `cat tasks.txt` command to display the contents of the `tasks.txt`.

```
Massimo@123456789:~/notes$ touch tasks.txt
Massimo@123456789:~/notes$ ls
tasks.txt
```
```
Massimo@123456789:~/notes$ cat tasks.txt
  Completed tasks:

  1. Used nano tasks.txt command to edit this file.
  2. Made sure to press CTRL + X then Y save the new data to tasks.txt.
  3. Used cat tasks.txt to display this information.
```

## Summary 
Here, I successfully demonstrated my ability to navigate and operate extremely basic functions on the Linux terminal, such as: 
- Find and search files,
- Create and remove directories,
- Move and remove files, and
- Create and edit a file on the Terminal.
