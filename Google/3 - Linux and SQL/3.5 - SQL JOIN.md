# Applying SQL JOIN

> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Project Description  
Management at my organization tasked me with investigating potential security issues and updating employee computers as needed. As a Linux administrator, I typically used SQL filters to carry out security-related tasks. However, in this scenario, I utilized SQL JOIN to work with the values from two tables, a task closely related to relational database management.

## Inner Join
I crafted an SQL query on MassimoDB to perform an inner join on two tables, focusing on the intersection where only rows with matching values in both tables were considered. 

> The “employees” table.

```
MassimoDB [organization] > SELECT
FROM employees;

Here’s the query that retrieves the username, operating system, and employee ID from both tables. The username and operating system are each sourced from one of the tables, while the employee ID, which appears in both tables, is referenced using the “table.column” format to avoid ambiguity. The result of this query provides 185 usernames along with their corresponding operating systems and device IDs. Additional variations of the inner join can be found on the following pages.

## Return More Data 
**Left Join:** 
This operation ensures that the results include all records from one table, even if there is no match in the other table. In this scenario, I linked the tables using the common `device_id` column. With a left join, all records from the table specified after `FROM` and before `LEFT JOIN` are included in the results. Specifically, all records from the "machines" table are displayed, regardless of whether they are assigned to an employee in the "employees" table or not.

```
MassimoDB [organization]> SELECT * 
FROM machines 
LEFT JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;

**Right Join:**  
A right join ensures that all records from one table are included in the results, even if there are no corresponding matches in the other table. In this scenario, I linked the tables using the common `device_id` column. With a right join, all records from the table specified after `RIGHT JOIN` are included in the results. Specifically, all records from the "employees" table are displayed, regardless of whether they have associated values in the "machines" table or not.

```
MassimoDB [organization]> SELECT *
FROM machines
RIGHT JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;

> Both resulted in 200 rows each; however, some data were recorded as NUL due to the types of JOIN used. 

## Summary
I crafted queries to join two tables in three different scenarios: Inner Join, Left Join, and Right Join.
