> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Case Study

**Botium Toys**: A small U.S.-based company specializing in toy development and sales, operating from a single location that doubles as their office, store, and warehouse. Despite their modest size, they’ve experienced significant growth, especially online, attracting customers both domestically and internationally. This expansion has increased the demands on their IT department, which now needs to support a more complex global market.

The IT department manager recognizes the need for an internal IT audit, driven by concerns over the lack of a robust plan to ensure business continuity and compliance amidst the company’s growth. She believes that this audit will not only help secure the company’s infrastructure but also uncover potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. Additionally, she aims to ensure compliance with regulations surrounding online payment processing and business operations within the European Union (EU).

To address these challenges, the manager is adopting the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. Her approach includes defining the scope and goals of the audit, cataloging all assets under the IT department’s management, and conducting a thorough risk assessment. The primary objective of the audit is to evaluate the risks and potential fines the company might face due to its current security posture.

**Your Role:** Evaluate the scope, goals, and risk assessment provided by the IT manager and conduct an internal audit by completing a detailed controls and compliance checklist.

## Scenario

### Scope

The audit covers Botium Toys’ entire security program, including an evaluation of all assets, internal processes, and procedures related to implementing cybersecurity controls and compliance best practices.

### Goals

The main goal is to thoroughly assess current assets, identify gaps in the security framework, and complete a controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and best practices need to be implemented to enhance Botium Toys’ overall security posture.

### Current Assets

- On-premises equipment for in-office business operations, including servers and networking hardware.
- Employee devices such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, remote workstations, and peripheral devices like headsets and docking stations.
- Physical products stored in the company's warehouse, available for both on-site and online retail.
- Management systems, including accounting, telecommunication, database management, security, ecommerce platforms, and inventory management systems.
- Internet access, internal networking infrastructure, data retention and storage systems, and legacy systems that require manual oversight and maintenance.

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Description:** Asset management at Botium Toys is currently inadequate. The company lacks comprehensive controls, leading to significant non-compliance with U.S. and international regulations and standards. This gap exposes the company to potential security breaches and regulatory penalties.

**Control Best Practices:** The **Identify** function of the NIST CSF is critical here. Botium Toys must allocate resources to properly identify and manage its assets. This includes classifying existing assets and evaluating the impact that losing these assets, including critical systems, would have on business continuity.

**Risk Score:** The risk score has been assessed at **8 out of 10**, indicating a high level of risk due to insufficient controls and a lack of adherence to best practices.

**Additional Comments:** The potential impact of asset loss is rated as medium because the IT department is not fully aware of which assets are most vulnerable. Moreover, the risk of fines or compliance-related issues is high due to insufficient controls and failure to meet regulatory requirements that protect sensitive and critical data.

**Control Types in Cybersecurity:**

1. **Administrative/Managerial Controls:** Policies and procedures governing how security is managed.
2. **Technical Controls:** Mechanisms like firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption that directly protect data.
3. **Physical/Operational Controls:** Physical measures such as locks, surveillance systems, and environmental safeguards.

**Defense and Protection Controls:**

1. **Preventative Controls:** Designed to prevent incidents from occurring, such as access controls and firewalls.
2. **Corrective Controls:** Aimed at restoring systems and data after an incident, including backups and disaster recovery plans.
3. **Detective Controls:** Help in identifying and responding to incidents, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and monitoring.
4. **Deterrent Controls:** Measures that discourage malicious activities, such as security policies and legal warnings.
