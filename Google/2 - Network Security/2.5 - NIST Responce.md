# Cybersecurity Framework NIST  

> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Scenario 

As a cybersecurity analyst for a multimedia company offering web design, graphic design, and social media marketing services, you are tasked with improving network security following a DDoS attack. The attack, which involved a flood of ICMP packets, rendered the internal network unresponsive for two hours. The company responded by blocking ICMP packets, stopping non-critical network services, and restoring critical services. To enhance future security, you will apply the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

## Summary

The ICMP flood attack overwhelmed the network, causing service disruptions. The company responded by blocking the malicious traffic and restoring critical services. 

## NIST CSF Implementation

| No | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Identify** <br> - **Technology/Asset**: The affected systems included the internal network and services. <br> - **Process/Business Environment**: All operational tasks were disrupted due to the attack. <br> - **People**: All staff requiring access to the internal network were affected. <br> **Response**: The attack targeted the company's network, disrupting internal operations. Restoring the network is crucial for resuming normal operations. |
| 2 | **Protect** <br> - **Access Controls**: Implement firewall rules to limit ICMP packet rates and verify source IP addresses. <br> - **Awareness/Training**: Alert cybersecurity teams to the attack and update procedures. <br> - **Data Security**: Ensure data is secure and procedures are updated. <br> - **Information Protection and Procedures**: Regularly update firewall rules and monitoring systems. <br> - **Maintenance**: Update hardware, OS, and software. <br> - **Protective Technology**: Implement IDS/IPS systems to filter suspicious ICMP traffic. <br> **Response**: Implement new firewall rules, update device status, and deploy an IDS/IPS system. |
| 3 | **Detect** <br> - **Anomalies and Events**: Use SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk, LogRhythm) to detect and alert on abnormal traffic patterns. <br> - **Security Continuous Monitoring**: Configure source IP address verification and use tools like Wireshark or TCPdump. <br> - **Detection Process**: Utilize IDS/IPS for real-time detection of suspicious activity. <br> **Response**: Use network monitoring software and configure IP verification to detect and respond to abnormal traffic. |
| 4 | **Respond** <br> - **Planning**: Develop and implement action plans for future attacks. <br> - **Communications**: Inform staff and affected users about response procedures. <br> - **Analysis**: Analyze network logs to identify attack vectors and impacts. <br> - **Mitigation**: Isolate affected systems and restore critical services. <br> - **Improvements**: Enhance response procedures and incident reporting. <br> **Response**: Establish a risk management plan, communicate with stakeholders, and analyze network logs to improve response procedures. |
| 5 | **Recover** <br> - **Recovery Planning**: Restore affected resources and systems. <br> - **Improvements**: Evaluate and improve recovery processes. <br> - **Communications**: Inform stakeholders about recovery progress and procedures. <br> **Response**: Prioritize restoring critical services, use firewalls to block ICMP flood attacks, and bring non-critical services online once the attack subsides. |
