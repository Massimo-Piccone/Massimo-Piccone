# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Analyze Network Attacks

> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Scenario

You are a security analyst at a travel agency that promotes vacation packages on the company’s website. Employees frequently access this sales webpage to find appealing vacation options for customers.

One afternoon, you receive an automated alert from your monitoring system about an issue with the web server. Attempting to visit the website, you encounter a connection timeout error message in your browser.

Using a packet sniffer to capture data packets to and from the web server, you observe a large number of TCP SYN requests from an unfamiliar IP address. The server seems overwhelmed by the excessive number of SYN requests, affecting its ability to respond. You suspect a malicious attack is underway.

To address the issue, you temporarily take the server offline for recovery and configure the company’s firewall to block the offending IP address. However, this IP blocking solution may be temporary since attackers can spoof other IP addresses. You need to promptly alert your manager about the situation and discuss further actions to mitigate the attack and prevent future occurrences. You must be ready to explain the type of attack, its impact on the web server, and its effects on employees.

## Potential Cause of Network Interruption

* The website's connection timeout error message could be due to a: DOS attack.
* The logs reveal that: The web server stops responding after being inundated with SYN packet requests.
* This situation suggests a: SYN flood attack.

## How the Attack is Causing the Website Malfunction

When visitors attempt to connect to the web server, a three-way handshake occurs using the TCP protocol. The three steps of this handshake are:

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | `SYN`: The client sends a SYN packet to the server to initiate a connection. |
| 2 | `SYN/ACK`: The server responds with a SYN/ACK packet, acknowledging the client's SYN and requesting confirmation. |
| 3 | `ACK`: The client sends an ACK packet to the server, confirming the connection. |

* When a malicious actor sends a large number of SYN packets simultaneously, it overwhelms the server’s resources, preventing it from processing legitimate connection requests. This flood of SYN packets consumes server resources, resulting in no available capacity for genuine connections.
* The logs indicate that the server is overloaded and cannot handle additional requests, causing new visitors to receive a connection timeout message.
