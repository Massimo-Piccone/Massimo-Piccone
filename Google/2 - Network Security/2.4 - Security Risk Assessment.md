# Security Risk Assessment Report: Network Hardening

> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Scenario

As a security analyst for a social media organization, you are tasked with addressing vulnerabilities following a major data breach that compromised customersâ€™ personal information. The organization has identified four major vulnerabilities:

1. Employees share passwords.
2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3. Firewalls lack rules for filtering traffic.
4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not implemented.

Failure to address these vulnerabilities puts the organization at risk of future breaches and attacks. This report outlines recommended network hardening practices to prevent such issues.

## Part 1: Hardening Tools and Methods

1. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - MFA enhances security by requiring users to verify their identity using multiple methods. These may include:
     - **Something You Are**: Biometrics such as fingerprints or retina scans.
     - **Something You Have**: Devices like ID cards or mobile phones.
     - **Something You Know**: PINs or passwords.

2. **Enforce Strong Password Policies**
   - Develop policies requiring:
     - Complex passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
     - Regular password changes.
     - Prevention of password sharing.
     - Lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.

3. **Perform Regular Firewall Maintenance and Port Filtering**
   - Regularly update and configure firewalls to:
     - Detect and block malicious traffic.
     - Implement port filtering to restrict unauthorized access to specific network ports.
     - Continuously monitor for suspicious activity.

## Part 2: Explanation of Recommendations

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by adding an additional verification layer. This makes it difficult for attackers to gain access even if they acquire passwords through brute force attacks or other means. MFA ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive systems.

2. **Strong Password Policies**
   - Enforcing strong password policies fortifies the organization against attacks targeting weak passwords. Complex passwords and regular changes reduce the risk of successful password guessing attacks. Policies against password sharing prevent unauthorized access through compromised credentials.

3. **Firewall Maintenance and Port Filtering**
   - Regular firewall maintenance ensures that security configurations are up-to-date and effective against evolving threats. Port filtering controls the types of network traffic allowed, preventing unauthorized access and mitigating risks from DoS and DDoS attacks. Monitoring and updating firewall rules help in promptly detecting and responding to suspicious activities.
