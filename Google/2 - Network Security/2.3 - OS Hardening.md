# Cybersecurity Incident Report: OS Hardening

> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.

## Scenario

As a cybersecurity analyst for yummyrecipesforme.com, a website specializing in selling recipes and cookbooks, you face a critical situation. A disgruntled baker has executed a brute force attack to gain unauthorized access to the web host. They used known default passwords for the administrative account until they succeeded in logging in. After accessing the admin panel, they altered the website's source code to embed a JavaScript function that prompted visitors to download and run a file. This file redirected customers to a fake version of the website where recipes were available for free.

Several hours post-attack, customers reported receiving prompts to download a file to update their browsers. Running the file caused their browsers to redirect to a fake site, greatrecipesforme.com, which now hosts the stolen recipes and causes the customers' computers to slow down. 

The website owner, unable to log in to the admin panel, contacted the hosting provider. As a cybersecurity analyst, you need to investigate this incident. You set up a sandbox environment, use tcpdump to capture traffic and observe the website's behaviour. You find that the website prompts for a malicious download and redirects to the fake site.

## Network Protocol HTTP

The incident involves the HTTP protocol, operating over port 80. The tcpdump analysis captured traffic related to DNS (port 53) and HTTP, indicating that the attack occurred at the application layer, with HTTP being the primary protocol affected by the malicious activity.

## Documentation of the Incident

Several customers encountered a prompt to download a file when visiting the website, which led to their accounts being locked out after executing the file. 

Here’s a summary of the incident:

1. **Initial Detection**: Customers reported being prompted to download a file that appeared to update their browsers.
2. **Sandbox Testing**: The security team created a sandbox environment to investigate. Running tcpdump, they observed the website's prompt to download the file and noted that the file redirected browsers to a fake site (greatrecipesforme.com), mimicking the real site (yummyrecipesforme.com).
3. **Traffic Analysis**: Logs showed:
   - **DNS Resolution**: Requests for yummyrecipesforme.com resolved to the correct IP address.
   - **HTTP Requests**: After the connection was established, users were prompted to download a file.
   - **Malicious Redirect**: Following the file execution, DNS resolution for greatrecipesforme.com was observed, leading to HTTP requests to the fake site.

The analysis revealed that the attack involved injecting JavaScript code to prompt malicious file downloads and redirect users to a fake site. The brute force attack on the admin account allowed the attacker to compromise and modify the site.

## Recommend Remediation for Brute Force Attacks

To prevent brute force attacks, implement **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**. This security measure requires users to provide two forms of verification before gaining access:

1. **Password**: The user’s standard login credential.
2. **One-Time Password (OTP)**: Sent to the user’s email or phone, adding an extra layer of security.

With 2FA, even if an attacker succeeds in guessing or brute-forcing a password, they would still need the additional authentication factor, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
