# Wireshark - Analyze Your First Packet
> This project is a simulated exercise, and all information presented is purely fictional for educational purposes.
## Scenario

As a security analyst, you're investigating traffic to a website. Youâ€™ll examine a network packet capture file containing data related to a user connecting to an internet site. Filtering network traffic using packet sniffers is a crucial skill for security analysts. 

You need to:
1. Identify the source and destination IP addresses in the web browsing session.
2. Examine the protocols used when the user connects to the website.
3. Analyze the data packet to determine the type of information sent and received during the connection.

### Key Packet Property Columns:
- `No`: Index number of the packet in the capture file.
- `Time`: Timestamp of the packet.
- `Source`: Source IP address.
- `Destination`: Destination IP address.
- `Protocol`: Protocol contained in the packet.
- `Length`: Total packet length.
- `Info`: Interpreted data about the packet's payload.

## Solutions

### 1. Identify the Source and Destination IP Addresses
- To filter traffic associated with a specific IP address, type `ip.addr == 142.250.1.139` in the title bar and select the first packet containing `TCP` in the info field. Here, `addr` represents either the source or destination IP.

- For filtering traffic from a specific source IP, type `ip.src == 142.250.1.139`. The `src` filter specifies the origin of the packet.

- To filter traffic destined for a specific IP, use `ip.dst == 142.250.1.139`. The `dst` filter specifies the destination of the packet.

- To filter by Ethernet MAC address, type `eth.addr == 42:01:ac:15:e0:02`. Here, `addr` refers to either the source or destination MAC address.

### 2. Examine the Protocols Used
- The TCP destination port is 80 when `ip.addr == 142.250.1.139`, indicating an HTTP website typically listening on TCP port 80.

- For Ethernet address `42:01:ac:15:e0:02`, the destination port is TCP, with the source address `172.21.224.2` and destination address `35.235.244.34`.

### 3. Analyze the Data Packet
- To filter for traffic on a specific port, type `tcp.port == 80`. This filter shows only traffic on TCP port 80.

- With `tcp.port == 80` filter applied, the `Time to Live (TTL)` value is 64.
  - **TTL**: Indicates the maximum duration an IP packet can exist before being discarded. It helps prevent packets from looping indefinitely in the network and can limit how far packets propagate as a basic security measure.

- The `Frame Number` is 37, and the `Frame Length` is 54 bytes with the `tcp.port == 80` filter applied.
  - **Frame Number**: Sequence number of a packet within a capture session, useful for referencing specific packets.
  - **Frame Length**: Total packet size, including headers and payload, measured in bytes. This is important for analyzing data transmission size and potential issues like fragmentation.
