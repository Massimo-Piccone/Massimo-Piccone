# Hello, I'm Massimo.

Driven by a passion for problem-solving and innovation, I began my career as an entry specialist, mastering the art of bypassing and securing access in the physical domain. Now, Iâ€™m transitioning into cybersecurity to continue developing and exploring my passions and talents. Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my competence.

## Objective 

My goal is to make an impact through my cybersecurity career - without a degree. 
I believe that real-world experience combined with dedicated, continuous learning leads to more sustainable long-term success. This approach is not only more relevant and efficient but also practical, ensuring that skills remain up-to-date and directly applicable to real challenges.
